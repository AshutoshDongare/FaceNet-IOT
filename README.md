This sample takes base FaceNet solution and builds IOT for continuous face recognition by looping through below steps 
1) Take a snap
2) Identify and align faces using MTCNN
3) Invoke Facenet to identify face
4) Print result of recognized faces
5) Start over

You may want to first go through https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet in detail to set up trained model to identify your custom set of faces and use this sample to run IOT on that.
